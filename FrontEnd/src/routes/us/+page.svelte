            <div>Hi! My name is Elizabeth and I am a rising senior studying Computer
                Science and Mathematics at Mount Holyoke College.
                I love building products and learning new technologies.
                Forest Code started off as an independent study during the Spring Semester of my Junior year, 
                where I was able to learn so much about Svelte, and other front-end tools.
                I am so excited to continue on this journey and learn more!</div>
