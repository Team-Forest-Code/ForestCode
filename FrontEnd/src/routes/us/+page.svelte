            <div >Hi! My name is Elizabeth and I am a rising senior studying Computer
                Science and Mathematics at Mount Holyoke College.
                I love building products and learning new technologies.
                Forest Code started off as an independent study during the Spring Semester of my Junior year, 
                where I was able to learn so much about Svelte, and other front-end tools.
                I am so excited to continue on this journey and learn more!</div>

            <div>Hi! I'm Nayeon (pronounced nah-yawn). I'm a rising senior at Mount Holyoke College, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Film, Media, Theater. While my future career path remains undecided, I aim to utilize technologies to create media and entertainment products that bring joy to people's lives. Through ForestCode, I've acquired valuable insights into the rapid iteration process of digital product development and learned when to seek help from a more experienced developer.</div>
